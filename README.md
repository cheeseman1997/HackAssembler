# HackAssembler
This is Nand2Tetris' week 6's final project.

The 6th (and final) week's project is to create a simple assembler that reads a file written in "Hack" assembly (.ams file) and converts it into binary code (.hack file), using the given parameters (written here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HxjPmIZkFHl-BVW3qoz8eD9dqEuEyuBI/view)
I wrote it in Java (version 19), and can run on most computer.

This is a simplified version of how an assembler works.
